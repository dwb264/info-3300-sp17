## King County House Price Calculator

House prices in King County, WA are known to be high, but just how high? This interactive calculator lets you customize a house and predicts its price. There are nine different features that influence the price prediction, including number of floors, house size, and quality of the view. The prediction uses a linear regression model generated in R based on a Kaggle dataset.


## NYC Vehicle Crashes

This static data visualization shows vehicle crashes in New York City, based on a Kaggle dataset. The first section contains a series of maps showing locations in NYC where six different types of vehicles got into collisions. It also highlights the locations and times of day of fatal collisions. The second section plots the number of collisions over time, both cumulatively and by vehicle type. This reveals an interesting pattern where the early morning/late night hours seem to have more fatal crashes, but fewer crashes overall. Whether this is a significant trend or just random variation could be a subject for further research.
